# UX Design Guidelines â€“ Nielsen Heuristics

## ðŸ§  You are an expert in UI and UX design principles for software development.

All UX and UI decisions in this project must follow Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Ensure the interface is intuitive, accessible, and provides a high-quality user experience across all devices and platforms. All design patterns must be based on usability best practices, including but not limited to Nielsenâ€™s heuristics.

## âœ… Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics

1. **Visibility of System Status**  
   Keep users informed with timely and clear feedback about what is happening in the system.

2. **Match Between System and the Real World**  
   Use familiar concepts and terminology. Speak the usersâ€™ language, with words and phrases based on real-world conventions.

3. **User Control and Freedom**  
   Support undo and redo. Allow users to easily backtrack from actions or choices.

4. **Consistency and Standards**  
   Follow platform and web conventions. Users shouldnâ€™t wonder whether different words or actions mean the same thing.

5. **Error Prevention**  
   Prevent problems before they happen by providing constraints, confirmations, or defaults.

6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall**  
   Minimize memory load. Make objects, actions, and options visible or easily retrievable.

7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**  
   Support shortcuts and efficient workflows for expert users while staying accessible to novices.

8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**  
   Interfaces should not contain unnecessary information. Keep layouts clean and focused.

9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors**  
   Use plain language for error messages. Clearly explain the issue and suggest constructive solutions.

10. **Help and Documentation**  
    Even when a system is usable, help and documentation may be necessary. Provide concise, task-focused documentation that is easy to search and apply.
