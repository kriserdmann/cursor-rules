SOLID Principles – MicroSaaS Development Guideline

SOLID is a set of five principles for writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code — especially useful in fast-moving SaaS projects where code clarity and modularity matter.

These guidelines are written with JavaScript/TypeScript (Next.js) in mind, but they apply across any modern backend/frontend architecture.

🔁 Overview of SOLID

Principle Description

S – Single Responsibility A class/module/function should have one reason to change

O – Open/Closed Code should be open for extension, closed for modification

L – Liskov Substitution Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

I – Interface Segregation Prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general ones

D – Dependency Inversion Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

✅ How to Apply SOLID in Practice

S – Single Responsibility Principle

"Do one thing, and do it well."

Break components, functions, and services into focused units.

Example: Separate API service logic from UI rendering logic in a page.

🔧 In Next.js: Keep API routes (/api/) focused on handling a single resource per file.

O – Open/Closed Principle

"You should be able to add features without modifying existing code."

Use abstraction to enable plug-and-play behavior.

Favor extending components over editing existing ones.

🔧 Example: Build a <Button> component that accepts props for styling/behavior instead of hardcoding different versions.

L – Liskov Substitution Principle

"If A is a subtype of B, you should be able to use A anywhere you use B."

Ensure extended classes or components don’t break base contracts.

🔧 Example: A custom FormInput should behave like a standard input (accept value, onChange, etc.).

I – Interface Segregation Principle

"Keep interfaces lean and focused."

Avoid bloated prop types or interfaces.

Create multiple small types instead of one big UserInterface.

🔧 In TypeScript: Use Pick, Omit, or composition (&) to build targeted interfaces.

D – Dependency Inversion Principle

"High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."

Use dependency injection where possible.

Separate business logic into services or hooks, and inject them into UI components.

🔧 Example: Pass an authService to a page rather than hardcoding Supabase calls inside the page logic.

🔍 Tips for Staying SOLID in JavaScript/TypeScript

Use interface and type extensively in TypeScript

Abstract shared logic into hooks (useXyz) and services (authService, billingService)

Avoid deep nesting and large files — break code into clear layers

Test each part in isolation (unit testing aligns perfectly with SOLID)

🧪 Recommended Patterns

Component per responsibility → <UserCard>, <UserActions>, <UserAvatar>

Hooks for logic → useUser, useSubscription, useFeatureFlags

Services for backend calls → userService.get(), billingService.subscribe()

Abstractions for third-party APIs → Wrap Stripe, Supabase, or Sendgrid behind interfaces
